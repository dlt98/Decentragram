This is a simple project to make a decentralized blockchain instagram.

It consists of :

    1. Smart contract which allows the storage of IPFS image hash and to tip the owner of the image
    2. Frontend built with React and web3.js to connect the smart contract to frontend app

Original idea from DappUniversity
